LED Calendar Reminder
==============
I was helping a friend do a quick prototype of a watch that visually notifies you of upcoming Google Calendar events.

This solution is based off of the approach taken in [this project](http://www.instructables.com/id/Wiring-up-the-LCD-and-the-LED). Essentially, Python code is contacting Google Calendar then over serial tells Arduino if there is an upcoming event.
